    <p class="paragraph">Hello, I am Avrey James Anderson Sr. I am a politician and businessman from Dripping Springs, Texas. I was born in Houston, Texas on May 20th 2003. I ran for District Clerk of Hays County, Texas In 2022 at age 19. I went to Dripping Springs High School and graduated in 2021. I did well in economics, government, physics, and mathematics. I started college for a degree in Computer Infomation Technology and learned how to program computers and build websites in the summer of 2021. Right now I am currently halfway done with my degree program and hope for an electoral win in november of 2022. My political, governmental, and entrepreneurial interests can be understood and highlighted in various themes throughout this blog. I will also add references to political, and entrepreneurial ideas of mine in this blog.   </p>

    <h1 class="small-title-r">About My Politics</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">I am Extremely Liberal in many ways as I am for the representation and freedom of all individuals regardless of race,
      sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, ethnicity, ideology, political offiliation, or religion.
      I used to be more conservative due to the fact that I used to be a religious person. After many troubles I gave up the lie of religion and was thenceforth changed into a very fact based person.
      I do not believe that anyone deserves a right to influencing legislation without reasonable ability to form a hypothesis.
      My idea of government is hypothesis based in stead of opinion based. My thoughts on governmental efficiency is that we should have an unchanging
      constitution that protects the rights of bodily autonomy, life, liberty, and property. These rights should also protect all freedom of expression and
      in many cases hold contracting liberty above the judicial form of government. With an unalterable constitution no person shall ever suffer the
      possibility of legislative denial or seizure of these unalienable rights. This will allow legislation to only encompass certain things based on
      hypothetical congress (multiple congress' with the ability to form educated and intellectual votes on legislation that only they can represent)
      for example a congress that determines economic/foreign policy would be a congress built of people qualified as economists through standardized
      examination and certification. These temporary and qualified congressmen will only be assembled for half a year and shall be appointed instead of elected.
      The perfect summarization to my political belief is a common issue that is necessary to bring up. If a congress was assembled to rule upon the
      "right to abortion" would you prefer it to be a congress that was elected by the unqualified masses ridden with ideology and "OPINIONS" or would you
      prefer a congress of temporarily appointed medical professionals to propose and decide with "EDUCATED GUESSES/HYPOTHESIS" how abortion should be limited
      or implemented? Keep in mind the congress of ideologies similar to the one the U.S.A has displays no qualifications for such laws and can also influence
      a "changeable constitution" thus having the ability to change a female humans right to bodily autonomy. In this government religious institutions will file taxes and can not register as a non-profit. In this government religious institutions must file as a misinformed organization where they file the many lies they tell our citizens throughout their life.  </p>
