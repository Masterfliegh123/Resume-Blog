    <p class="paragraph">Hello, I am Avrey James Anderson Sr. I am a politician and businessman from Dripping Springs, Texas. I was born in Houston, Texas on May 20th 2003. I ran for District Clerk of Hays County, Texas In 2022 at age 19. I went to Dripping Springs High School and graduated in 2021. I did well in economics, government, physics, and mathematics. I started college for a degree in Computer Infomation Technology and learned how to program computers and build websites in the summer of 2021. Right now I am currently halfway done with my degree program and hope for an electoral win in november of 2022. My political, governmental, and entrepreneurial interests can be understood and highlighted in various themes throughout this blog. I will also add references to political, and entrepreneurial ideas of mine in this blog.   </p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="small-title-r">About My Politics</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">I am Extremely Liberal in many ways as I am for the representation and freedom of all individuals regardless of race,
      sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, ethnicity, ideology, political offiliation, or religion.
      I used to be more conservative due to the fact that I used to be a religious person. After many troubles I gave up the lie of religion and was thenceforth changed into a very fact based person.
      I do not believe that anyone deserves a right to influencing legislation without reasonable ability to form a hypothesis.
      My idea of government is hypothesis based in stead of opinion based. My thoughts on governmental efficiency is that we should have an unchanging
      constitution that protects the rights of bodily autonomy, life, liberty, and property. These rights should also protect all freedom of expression and
      in many cases hold contracting liberty above the judicial form of government. With an unalterable constitution no person shall ever suffer the
      possibility of legislative denial or seizure of these unalienable rights. This will allow legislation to only encompass certain things based on
      hypothetical congress (multiple congress' with the ability to form educated and intellectual votes on legislation that only they can represent)
      for example a congress that determines economic/foreign policy would be a congress built of people qualified as economists through standardized
      examination and certification. These temporary and qualified congressmen will only be assembled for half a year and shall be appointed instead of elected.
      The perfect summarization to my political belief is a common issue that is necessary to bring up. If a congress was assembled to rule upon the
      "right to abortion" would you prefer it to be a congress that was elected by the unqualified masses ridden with ideology and "OPINIONS" or would you
      prefer a congress of temporarily appointed medical professionals to propose and decide with "EDUCATED GUESSES/HYPOTHESIS" how abortion should be limited
      or implemented? Keep in mind the congress of ideologies similar to the one the U.S.A has displayed no qualifications for such laws and can also influence
      a "changeable constitution" thus having the ability to change a female humans right to bodily autonomy.
      In this government religious institutions will file taxes and can not register as a non-profit. 
      In this government religious institutions must file as a for profit organization. In this government the people are free but are not guaranteed a say in legislation.
      In this government legislation does not deprive anyone of liberty except through the case of preventing the deprivation of another's liberty.
      This government will have an astute militia and will focus its taxes into the states science programs.
      Citizens of this country should be able to have a free education as well as extreme funding for the improvement and discovery in the fields of particle physics, longevity based biology, and interstellar travel.
      This government will not limit cloning in any way unless the cloning is used at the expense of our citizens' liberty.
      Our society is consent based which means that a person may deprive themself of their own liberty. 
      Foreign nations may not own property in this nation nor will they be disposed to involve themselves with secretive meetings or bribe justices.
      Our system will provide extremely harsh punishments to officials who abuse their power for any means whatsoever.<strong> I am running for District Clerk in Hays County, Texas as a democrat with the intent to boost the efficiency of our drastically disorganized court room with the implementation of databases and organizational software. As a result of our governments failure to allow for extreme direct feedback I have decided to add a complaint page here on my blog so I may review the opinions , thoughts , and complaints of those I will serve and represent.</strong> </p>
    <h1 class="small-title-r">About My Entrepreneurial Interests</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">I started working political campaigns when I was 15 years old and worked with such success as to manage a campaign at the age of 18 for a gentleman who was running for office. I as a political consultant have the power and skills to teach others how to run for office, run campaigns, advise with my political expertise, and run for office my self as I have with my candidacy for District Clerk. I am interested in many forms of business. I worked at a convenience store for a while and after getting let go I decided to launch a landscaping business around Dripping Springs, Texas. This business brought me an average wage of 40$/h and gave me plenty of business. I also took it into my many goals to create a political consulting certification course which can be found at www.politipp.net. In this course I highlight the role of a political consultant and give resources to which a person can build upon a framework to one day become political consultants themselves. I have also scored many tasks in web development helping some businesses and colleagues of mine with their websites in JavaScript, html, and css. I have also dealt with server side languages such as nodejs, and php. I am also working on selling products in mass to many retailers such as my own perfume named "Patria D'agostina". I am also building relationships with businesses all over so that we may trade our expertise and create a stronger environment within our b2b , and even b2c relations. I can generate leads for businesses as well as build a more efficient database with less complexity to insure a businesses' order.</p>
